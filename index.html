			<p>Computers are amazing tools. The human brain is obviously more powerful,
			   but without computers we wouldn't have figured out many of the things we 
			   know. The creative problem solving is done by the person, but a lot of 
			   times it would take a person very much time to employ the solution to get the
			   answer or even more time than they would be alive. An example would be finding
			   a very large prime number for whatever purpose you may need it.
			</p>
			<p>Unknown to my knowledge there may be creative and intelligent ways for people to
			   find a large prime number but barring those possibities, a computer would be 
			   neccessary for the task. To find a prime number this way, one would have to try each
			   negative number to up to about half of half that number to see if it is divisible by
			   anything. New and creative proccesses are best done within the domain of human intelligence
			   but the raw power of being able to do almost innumerable calculations is exponentially 
			   faster and more efficient on a computer.
			</p>
			<p>Computers compute and people solve. It is entirely possible to have a solution that is nearly
			   or is impossible to employ. I run into this when trying to wrtie songs on guitar. I try to write 
			   things I can play by myself, but every once in awhile the note that would be the solution to resolve
			   the tension built is out of my fingers reach. I know that is the solution, but I can not successfully
			   employ it due to my human limitations. On a computer, however, any amount of any notes no matter the 
			   distance or overlap, can be played by a single machine.
